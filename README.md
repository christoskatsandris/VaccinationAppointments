# VaccinationAppointments

> Current version: 1.0.0.3

Easily track the availability for COVID-19 vaccination appointments with this simple program. You must only install the program once on your computer and then run it and leave it searching in the background.
It will make 10 attempts with your area's zipcode and, unless it finds an available appointment, it will exit.
If it finds an available appointment, a sound will play repetitively to inform you to take further action.

## Prerequisites
Google Chrome, version 91

## Notes
- Do not click anything at the browser window (unless it finds an available appointment, so make sure you're fast to reserve it!). The program will do everything for you. Just enter your TaxisNet credentials **in the console window** to log in.
- In case of an unhandled exception (crash), don't worry! You can safely discard it and run the program once again! Of course, I'll be happy to hear from you, so as to correct it as fast as possible!
- The automated web driver will log some information in the console window that might confuse you. You can safely discard it.
- In case of a newer version, you can download the installer files again, and run the setup file. The older version will be replaced by the newer in your computer.
